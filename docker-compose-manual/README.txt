The files in this folder do not have any use. I am keeping them in the repo only for my future reference. If I was an idealist and always practiced what I preach, I would actually delete them so I will have a clean repo. But... I am only human.

The files represent my (Hafiz Adewuyi) first attempt to enable Docker-Compose in the Solution. It was partially successful as I was able to run both Website and API in Docker containers. The challenges surfaced however when I tried to debug against my "composed" Docker containers.

To solve the problem, I followed the Microsoft recommended approach: "Add > Container Orchestration Support" and that worked well right out of the box (.dcproj project).
