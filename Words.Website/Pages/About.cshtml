                    YorubaWord.com is a multimedia dictionary project of the Yoruba Names Project.
                    It will be the first free, open, crowdsourced, multimedia, and monolingual lexical
                    dictionary of Yorùbá language on the internet, aimed at helping to better document
                    the language for the use of learners, students, and native speakers across the world,
                    but also to improve the presence of Yorùbá on the internet generally as a way to help
                    it survive into the next century.
                    <br><br>
                    That this dictionary is monolingual means that it is
                    not a translation dictionary with only direct equivalents in English.
                    <br><br>
                    Our aim for creating it is to create a place to better understand the meaning,
                    examples, sounds, context, and geolocation of all words used in the Yorùbá language.

                    <br><br>
