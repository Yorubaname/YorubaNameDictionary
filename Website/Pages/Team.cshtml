                    <strong>Dadepo ADÉRẸ̀MÍ</strong> was one of the first volunteers to join the team in early 2015. He
                    sees the world wide web as a universal platform and thus believes every culture/creed should be able
                    to utilize it for self expression. He currently helps in coordinating Software Development efforts
                    for the project, among other administrative roles.

                    For <strong>Laila LE GUEN</strong>, the Yorùbá Name dictionary was a great opportunity to engage with
                    two things she was already drawn to: Yorùbá? language learning and expanding linguistic diversity
                    online. She joined the project in March 2015 and she soon came to be involved in the drafting of the
                    newsletter, blog post editing, as well as some social media interactions. She also endeavoured to
                    bring on board Yorùbá? speakers from the Republic of Benin so as to ensure inclusive participation
                    across borders. She hopes that this dictionary will become a multilingual reference point for anyone
                    seeking information about Yorùbá? personal names, but also serve as an inspiration for other
                    language communities.
